The "what's next?" web application is my first react-based website. The purpose of this project is 
to demonstrate my understanding of the React library and how effective it is. In this website, you can 
see on the "to-do's" page the functionality of the to-do list. As the user adds an item to their to-do  
list, the user will be able to see the item(s) appear below.



How to use the app:

Once you go to the to-do's page, you are welcomed to a form to input your to-do items. As you type the item, you 
can press 'Enter' or click the 'add item' button. From there, your list item(s) will appear below. Once you have 
completed an item, click on the item's name and a check will appear. If you want to see all items you have 
completed, you can click the selection 'completed' where it will show them. If you want to see item you have not 
completed, you can click 'incomplete' where it will show what is left. If there is a to-do item you need to change, 
you can select the icon of the paper and pencil where you can change the item's name. If there is a to-do item you 
want to delete, just select the minus icon and the item will be gone. Happy listing!

Ideas for Future Improvement:

1. Adding more abilities for future users where there are more functions, such as adding desriptions 
or adding a due date to items.

2. Redesigning the web app to allow users to switch between a light and dark mode. Some users may not 
favor the light theme of the website.

3. Instead of keeping the to-do's appearing on the 'all' selector, allowing checked-off items to move directly to 
the 'completed' selector.
